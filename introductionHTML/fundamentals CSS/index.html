      href is what makes the anchor element <a> into a link. 
        Keeping it empty means the link doesn't go anywhere
        You can either have a link with href="" or u can also point to any other html files (basically pages) in this directory
        href = "" doesn't do anything
        href = "#" just takes it back to the top of the current page (like home button)

        All modern websites and web applications are built using three <em>fundamental</em>
        technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the
        web.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about,
        and why you too should learn it.
      </p>
      <h3>What is HTML?</h2>
        <p>
          HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext
          <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage. It's a markup language
          that web developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage
          (not a programming language).
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content:
          paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand
          HTML and render HTML code as websites.
        </p>
        
        <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The opening tag</li>
          <li>The closing tag</li>
          <li>The actual element</li>
        </ol>
        
        <!--

        <p>
          You can learn more at the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML" target="_blank">MDN Web Docs</a>
        </p>
        <h3>Why should you learn HTML?</h3>
        <p>There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of the web. Here are 5 of them:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>To be able to use the fundamental web dev language</li>
          <li>To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like Wordpress or Wix</li>
          <li>To build web applications</li>
          <li>To impress friends</li>
          <li>To have fun</li>
        </ul>
      <p>Hopefully you learned something new here. See you next time!</p>
